	release note.  

2002-11-08 11:40  djc

	* dist/dist-csv.sh: Added script to perform distribution process.  

2002-11-08 11:14  djc

	* csv.c, setup.py, dist/release-1.0pre1: More work towards the next
	release.  

2002-11-04 15:44  djc

	* csv.c: Changed int members back to char.  Improved module
	docstring.  

2002-11-04 15:33  djc

	* csv.c: Latest and greatest attempt to get pydoc csv acceptable.  

2002-11-04 12:57  djc

	* csv.c: First attempt at release ready code.  

2002-10-04 22:47  andrewm

	* csv.c, setup.py, test.py: 
	- Added new attribute "escape_char" - if no quote_char is set, this
	  will be used to escape special characters in output. On input, an
	  escape_char will remove the special meaning from the next character.
	  If the next character is not a special character, both the
	escape_char and the character are returned.  
	- Character attributes can now be set to "None", which disables that 
	  functionality (for instance, quote_char set to None removes their
	  special meaning on input, and will suppress the use of quotes for
	  escaping special characters on output.  
	- join_append has grown overly complicated - the chances of
	  mis-calculating the required buffer size are growing, so I've added
	  an assertion to the end of the function to pick up this situation.
	The whole function needs a rethink.  
	- Cleaned up Parser_setattr handling of single character arguments,
	  added to comment about T_CHAR bug (still exists in old Pythons, so
	  retaining work-around for time being).  
	- Added a bunch more unittests for new functionality (and a few
	  tests for old functionality that were missing). Generic output test
	  function handles options better.

	* test.py: 
	- make test script use local build directory, if populated, rather
	  than the installed version (so you can test before installing!) 

2002-10-03 14:37  djc

	* test.py: Added special test for Tim Churches: 
	    "this is not" a quoted field,"this is" 

2002-09-19 14:54  andrewm

	* csv.c, setup.py: 
	- Bumped version number to 1.0 (was 0.6) - should have been done
	long ago.  
	- Changed contact e-mail address to csv@object-craft.com.au 

2002-09-19 14:44  andrewm

	* csv.c: 
	- make join()'s behaviour vaguely sensible if ms_double_quote is
	false (sigh).  

2002-09-19 14:41  andrewm

	* csv.c: Make join() honour ms_double_quote 

2002-09-19 14:32  andrewm

	* csv.c, test.py: 
	- the quote character is now an attribute of the parser object -
	  "quote_char", with a default of the double quote character '"'.  
	- excel only treats the quote character as special if it appears as
	  the first character on a line - changed our parser to behave this
	  way, in the process removed two states from the parser.  
	- cleaned up the docstring for the parser object 
	- added more tests (for new functionality and based on testing Excel
	  97 behaviour).  

2002-09-19 13:13  andrewm

2002-09-17 15:41  andrewm

	- added more tests 

2002-09-17 15:22  andrewm
